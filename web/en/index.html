                        We firmly believe that open sourcing non-business critical components and contributing to existing projects leads to better software.
                        With Open Source code must come readability, test, documentation and, in a broader sense, uncompromised quality.
                        It is no surprise that the most important components (from the OS to service libraries) of most applications are Open Source components: Open Source ensures quality.
                        We maintain and contribute to Open Source because it has a philosophical value (we share knowledge and contribute to the state of the art), but also because it has a business value: it makes for more robust software.
